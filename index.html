    <h3>WEB</h3>
    <p>A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application
      for accessing the World Wide Web. When a user requests a web page from a particular website,
       the web browser retrieves the necessary
       content from a web server and then displays the page on the user's device.

A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often
confused.[1][2] A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites.
 However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have
 a web browser installed.[3]

Web browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets,
 and smartphones. In 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people used a browser.[4] The most
 used browser is Google Chrome, with a 63% global market share on all devices, followed
  by Safari with 19%.[5] Other notable browsers include Firefox and Microsoft Edge.</p>
